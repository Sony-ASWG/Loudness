This is an update to v.1.1, first published in August 2013.

Prior to that time, the loudness of audio content
could vary greatly from title to title, as well as
between those products and other media that can
be played on SIE platforms such as films, music,
and television broadcasts.

The purpose of the ASWG recommendations
contained within this paper are threefold:

• To give consumers a consistent loudness
experience between different titles and
associated media on Sony Interactive
Entertainment platforms.

• To promote good audio engineering practices.

• To protect the format that we deliver content on.
